Got it 👍
Here’s a clean **README.md** you can upload to GitHub for **Go (Golang) basics** 👇

# Golang Basics 🚀

This repository contains notes and examples for learning **Go programming language**.  

---

## 📌 Introduction to Go
- Go is an open-source, statically typed, compiled language designed at Google.  
- Known for **simplicity, concurrency support, and high performance**.  
- Go files have the extension `.go`.  

---

## 🛠 Installation
1. Download & install Go: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)  
2. Verify installation:  
   ```bash
   go version
````

3. Setup environment variables (`GOROOT`, `GOPATH`) if required.

---

## 📂 Basic Go Program

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

Run it with:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## ⚡ Go Basics

### Variables & Constants

```go
var name string = "Aashish"
age := 23         // shorthand
const PI = 3.14
```

### Data Types

* int, float64, string, bool, array, slice, map, struct

### Control Structures

```go
if age > 18 {
    fmt.Println("Adult")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Minor")
}

for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

### Functions

```go
func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

### Structs

```go
type Student struct {
    name string
    age  int
}
```

### Arrays, Slices & Maps

```go
arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
slice := []string{"go", "lang"}
m := map[string]int{"one": 1, "two": 2}
```

---

## 📦 Packages

* Every Go program starts with a `main` package.
* Import standard or custom packages.

```go
import "fmt"
```

---

## 🧵 Concurrency

Go has **goroutines** and **channels**.

```go
go func() {
    fmt.Println("Running in goroutine")
}()
```

---

## ✅ Run & Build

* Run file:

  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```
* Build executable:

  ```bash
  go build main.go
  ```
